# OVERVIEW

This project involves creating a model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as property type, location, assessed value, etc. 
Model training using Python, NumPy, Pandas for statistics and Matplotlib for vizualization apply. 

# SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset used for our project was obtained from the following platforms: Kaggle, Google search engine, and Connecticut Department of Transportation. It contains information about real estate transactions on the state of Connecticut for the 2001-2020 period. Each row in the dataset represents a single real estate transaction, and the columns provide details about each transaction. For each sale record, the file includes: town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment.

# CHALLENGES

- Comparing datasets with relevant information
- Extrapolating useful information from datasets
- Merging datasets
- Creating statistical metrics for analysing house prices
