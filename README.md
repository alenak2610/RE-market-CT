# PROJECT - Predicting Housing Prices in CT

# OVERVIEW

This project involves creating a model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Model training using Python, NumPy, Pandas for statistics and Matplotlib for vizualization apply. 

# SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset used for our project was obtained from the following platforms: Kaggle, Google search engine, and Connecticut Department of Transportation. It contains information about real estate transactions on the state of Connecticut for the 2001-2020 period. Each row in the dataset represents a single real estate transaction, and the columns provide details about each transaction. For each sale record, the file includes: town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment.
