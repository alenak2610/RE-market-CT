# OVERVIEW

This project involves creating a model that analyses housing prices based on various features such as property type, location, assessed value, number of beds, etc. 
Model training using Python, NumPy, Pandas for statistics and Matplotlib for vizualization apply. 

# SOURCE OF DATASET

The dataset used for our project was obtained from the following platforms: Kaggle, Google search engine, and Connecticut Department of Transportation. It contains information about real estate transactions on the state of Connecticut for the 2001-2020 period. Each row in the dataset represents a single real estate transaction, and the columns provide details about each transaction. For each sale record, the file includes: town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment.

# CHALLENGES

- Comparing datasets with relevant information
- Extrapolating useful information from datasets
- Merging datasets
- Creating statistical metrics for analysing house prices

# CONCLUSION

Our analysis of the housing data provides valuable insights for individuals looking to navigate the real estate market in the state of Connecticut. Through various visualizations and data manipulations, we have uncovered trends and patterns that explain various aspects of the housing scenario in Connecticut for the period from 2001 to 2020.

##### Town-specific trends: 
We examined average price trends for both the most and least expensive towns, offering a comprehensive view of how housing prices have fluctuated over the years for these types of towns. This information can be crucial for potential buyers or sellers in these areas. 
##### Price Trends over time: 
The historical analysis of house prices from 2001 to 2020 provides a broader review of market dynamics. It allows us to identify periods of growth or decline, supporting in strategic decision-making for those interested in long-term investments. It can be seen that when average home sale prices decrease, the number of houses sold increase. Popular months to sell houses are in the summer and less popular in the winter season.
##### Bedroom-Town analysis: 
By allowing users to input the number of bedrooms and a specific town, the analysis enables personalized insights into the average price trends. This information can guide prospective homebuyers in making informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.
##### Affordability Analysis: 
The affordability analysis empowers users by providing information on towns and the number of bedrooms they can afford within their specified budget. This helps individuals align their housing preferences with financial constraints.

In summary, this analysis supports users with the knowledge needed to navigate the real estate market in Connecticut effectively. Understanding the nuances of housing data is iessential for anyone engaging in real estate transactions, and this analysis serves as a guide for individuals seeking clarity in a market that is dynamic and continually changing.
